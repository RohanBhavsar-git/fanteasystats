"""
Leakage test for Phase 2b usage features (src/usage.py).

Families 1 (volume/share) and 2 (snap share) are NOT rolling/expanding
features -- each player-week's value is computed entirely from that week's
own pbp and snap-count rows, grouped within (team, season, week). There is
no trailing window to leak across yet (that's step 4, add_rolling_features,
which gets its own leakage test).

What this guards against: a bug that accidentally aggregates a "team total"
across more than one week (e.g. season-to-date instead of within-week),
which would make week N's feature quietly depend on weeks after N.

Note this is a narrower claim than PHASE_2B_6_SPEC.md's general point-in-time
rule ("features for week N use only weeks < N"). That rule describes ROLLING
features PREDICTING week N. Families 1-2 instead DESCRIBE week N's own game
-- information that exists once week N has been played -- so the boundary
tested here is "week N does not depend on weeks > N", not "week N does not
depend on week N itself". Truncating the source data at week N-1 (excluding
week N) would make every denominator NaN and the test would fail by
construction; that's not a leak, that's the feature correctly having no data
to work with.

"""
FanTeasy Stats -- season archive generator.

Produces data/output/archive/{season}.json: a frozen, final snapshot of one
COMPLETED season, same schema as data/output/player_advanced_stats.json
(projection/usage/trend/xfp/radar/heatmap per player), built with the exact
same point-in-time-safe machinery scripts/weekly_update.py uses for a live
week -- just with target_week set to one week PAST that season's actual
final real week, so every rolling/radar/heatmap aggregate reflects the
WHOLE real season, matching what the dashboard's live-Sleeper-sourced KPI
cards already show for an archived season. Predicting that hypothetical
"week after the season ended" is never leakage (see determine_target_week's
own docstring in weekly_update.py for the identical reasoning on the live
path) -- there IS no real row at or after it to leak from, by construction.

`simulation` is always null for an archive -- win probability / playoff
odds for a week that never happened isn't a real thing to compute, so this
script doesn't try.

Uses the already-committed model artifact (same one weekly_update.py
uses) rather than training a fresh one -- an archive is a snapshot with
today's best model, not a retrain. Reads the full 2018-2025
weekly_features.parquet directly (03_usage_features.ipynb's output)
instead of weekly_update.py's constrained history_seed approach: this is
a manual, occasional script, not a CI job under a fetch-cost budget, and
the full cached history is already on disk.

Run manually, per season, as new seasons complete:
    .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe scripts\\archive_season.py 2025

See src/ingest.py's SEASON_LEAGUE_IDS for which seasons are currently
archivable (this league's real Sleeper history) and PROJECT_CONTEXT.md's
Phase 9 findings (season archives + selector) for why only 2023-2025 are
actually shipped as of this writing despite 2021-2022 also existing in
SEASON_LEAGUE_IDS.

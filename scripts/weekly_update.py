FanTeasy Stats -- Phase 8: weekly-update.yml's entry point.

Inference only -- never trains anything. Loads the model artifact
retrain.yml already committed (src/artifacts.py::load_model_artifact),
fetches ONLY the current season's raw data, predicts the upcoming week, and
regenerates data/output/player_advanced_stats.json.

Why "current season only" is enough to predict a real week, even though
Phase 6/7's original point-in-time feature pipeline (Family 6's
add_rolling_features) needs prev_season_* from the season BEFORE the one
being predicted: retrain.yml's artifact carries a `history_seed` -- a small,
trimmed slice (src/pipeline.py::HISTORY_SEED_COLUMNS) of the most recent
couple of COMPLETED seasons' raw feature-input columns, embedded in the
artifact at retrain time. This script concatenates that seed with THIS
season's freshly-fetched raw features (Families 1-5 + xFP, computed the
same way retrain.py computes them, just for one season) and a target-week
stub row, then reuses src/export.py::build_target_week_features UNMODIFIED
to run add_context_features/add_rolling_features/add_trend_features over
the combined frame -- the exact same point-in-time mechanism the original
Phase 7 notebook used for a full 8-season table, just with a much smaller
"historical" base.

The tradeoff this creates, stated plainly rather than left implicit: the
candidate universe (get_export_candidates) and prev_season_* are only as
current as the LAST retrain's history_seed. A player who hasn't appeared in
the seed's ~2 seasons or in the current season isn't a candidate until the
next retrain re-seeds with fresher history. This is disclosed in the
exported JSON's meta.caveats (see WEEKLY_EXTRA_CAVEATS below), not hidden.

Phase 8 round 2 adds a `simulation` block (win probability for the target
week's real matchups, playoff-qualification odds for the rest of the
season) via src/simulate.py -- computed since Phase 6.5 but never written
anywhere until now. Null-safe by construction: get_sleeper_matchups
returns empty for a league with no real schedule yet (2026 is pre-draft as
of this writing), which short-circuits the whole simulation section before
any of it runs, so `simulation` stays None and the JSON key is `null` --
the dashboard's job is to render that as an honest empty state, not to
receive a differently-shaped payload depending on season state.

Run it locally with:

    regular season. Returns None (null-safe) the moment there's nothing
    real to simulate -- no draft has happened yet, so Sleeper has no
    matchups -- before touching anything else in this function.

    Predicting BEYOND target_week (every remaining regular-season week,
    for playoff odds) reuses the exact same build_target_week_features
    mechanism as target_week itself: nothing new has actually happened
    between target_week and a later week either (both are unplayed), so
    Family 6's rolling/prev_season_* features come out IDENTICAL across
    every remaining week's stub-row prediction -- only Family 5's
    per-week schedule context (opponent, home/away, spread) legitimately
    differs, which build_target_week_features already recomputes fresh
    per call since it re-runs add_context_features against the real
    schedule for whichever week it's asked about.

    Two simplifying assumptions, stated here rather than left implicit:
      - Each remaining week's starters are whatever Sleeper reports
        get_sleeper_matchups returning for THAT week -- for a genuinely
        future week (the live, in-season case this runs for) Sleeper
        carries the current default lineup forward until a manager
        actively changes it, so this is effectively "today's lineup, held
        constant" for real forward-looking runs. There is no honest way
        to predict a manager's future lineup decisions instead.
      - K/DST and any skill player missing model coverage get Sleeper's
        own point projection as a fixed, zero-variance contribution (see
        src/export.py::build_starter_quantile_rows) -- the same
        convention src/simulate.py's module docstring documents and the
        dashboard's own K/DST display already uses.
